The film revolves around Ajay (Nagarjuna), an unemployed youth who has a short temper and fights against injustice. He falls in love with Soniya (Sushmita Sen), the daughter of a wealthy businessman Sriram (Girish Karnad). Sriram agrees to their marriage on one condition: Ajay must control his anger for three months and not get into any trouble. Ajay accepts the challenge and joins Sriram's factory as a worker. However, he faces many difficulties from Sriram's rival and brother Easwar (Raghuvaran), who wants to ruin Sriram's business and reputation. Ajay also has to deal with the harassment of Easwar's henchmen, who try to provoke him into breaking his promise. Will Ajay be able to overcome these obstacles and marry Soniya? Or will he lose his love and his temper?
